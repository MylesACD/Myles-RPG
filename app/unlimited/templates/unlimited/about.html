    <h1>About Techniques</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p> Techniques are supplemental abilities unique to your character, that you chose how they grow more powerful. The limit of a techniques power is determined by its tags, which are
         general descriptors of what your technique does with different point costs associated.
        Generally techniques can be anything that fits narratively 
        for your character and within the power limits. 
        They are not exclusive for combat situations,

        multiple techniques but each can only be used once per session. The GM will create custom partial success options for each technique.
