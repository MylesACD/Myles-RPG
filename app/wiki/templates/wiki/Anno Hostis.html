In the  when Damn’niz’Khus ruled Mortus, the other extraplanars formed a coalition to defeat him. Uveptaca had already fought and lost to Damn’niz’Khus, being forced to flee back to Hell--which in that time was still a unified plane--bringing reports of the Terrible Dominator’s power. The Archdevils of the time decided to work together with the stovja (extinct giant civilization) to make a weapon capable of destroying Damn’niz’Khus. Jarlvyso Husavik manufactured a bell that could channel incredible amounts of power, once the bell was finished they gave it to the devils to add the enchantments. Inzater concocted a scheme to alter the nature of the bell so that it would bind Damn’niz’Khus to Mortus and then annihilate the plane. Inzater saw an opportunity to remove the giants who in the future would oppose their goals, this deed earned him association with betrayal, it was later posited that Damn’nizkhus sheer will influenced Inzater into this reckless action. <br class="wikidpad" />

When the Archdevil taca went into battle with the Lord of Demons and rang Omega Toll, Damn’niz’Khus reacted with lightning so furious that it cracked and corrupted Omega Toll whilst still ringing. In that moment Omega Toll switched allegiance becoming the most powerful artifact of chaos, destroying taca. Its next ring permeated throughout Ethos reaching Hell and truly annihilating taca. The subsequent rings collapsed the Jarldom of Husavik, creating the Sure Luck Sea. These echoes and their following destruction prompted Quultar to create the celestials that would eventually Liberate Mortus, chief of which was Echo of Worlds End (EWE, Bell) and Warm Light of Dawn(WLD, Morning Star). EWE being coordinator of the celestials, and WLD the most powerful. EWE was the first born celestial but is yet to enter Mortus, and as such is much less known. The celestial/godly language is that of ringing, tones, and hums due to their genesis from Zeta Toll.  <br class="wikidpad" />

Following the aftermath of the First Great Seal Jarlvyso Tir collected the now Zeta Toll and was only able to split it into two parts. Tir kept the bell, and sent the clapper to Hell with Phaeron. For many of the older devils, the celestial language pains them to remember their two-fold defeat at the many hands of Damn’niz’Khus and the Zeta Toll.     <br class="wikidpad" />

Celestials language is known by the name resonam to scholars. Due to celestials' strong relation to souls and their coming during apocalyptic events, mortals believe it's important to have some kind of resonam after their death, that it will attract a celestial's attention to give their soul a safe journey to Mat Trang. This manifests as church bells for funerals, carrying small hangs or mbiras on dangerous journeys, and playing jaw harps when preparing or using magic. <br class="wikidpad" />
