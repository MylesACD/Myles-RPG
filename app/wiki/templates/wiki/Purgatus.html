Devils have vastly different amounts of hard and societal power. Hard-power comes from a form of social contract between all devils that establishes who is the most powerful amongst them. Initially all devils have the exact same amount of hard-power, individuals choose to centralize it by giving away their power. The societal structure is not nessacarily organized along the same lines as hard-power.    {% endblock content%}
