The first and larger of the two moons that orbit Ethos, Mat Trang is the resting place for mortal souls. The moon has two halves the light side and dark side as it is old enough to be tidally locked. The dark side is the dwelling of Utumno, a limbo land where souls wander to damnation or to be thrust back to mundane realm for sinister purpose. The bright side of the moon is lorded by Nychta, who protects worthy souls and maintains the separation between the PM and the spectral plane. For this reason, Mat Trang is often called the soul of Quultar because it houses the souls of mortals.<br class="wikidpad" />

Nychta and the moon are huge parts of ancestor worship across Ethos, in many cultures full moons are nights of remembrance, a time to pay respect. Conversely new moons are considered unlucky or unprotective nights when foul forces cause mayhem.<br class="wikidpad" />

The second smaller moon, that was formerly Mt. Arnor, has many different names. Among the dwarves it is universally called Toma (false), which bleeds into the surrounding regions of the Cold Coast, Gailluer, The Glades, and Ne-Pog. Much of the Dunlaye call it Bizkorra (sprinter), the Menziis say Neokorra (new runner). Other names include: The Dancer, the second soul of Quultar, and Quultar reborn. <br class="wikidpad" />
