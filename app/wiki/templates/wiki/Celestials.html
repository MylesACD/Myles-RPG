<a name=".h0" class="wikidpad"></a><h2 class="wikidpad heading-level2">Celestials</h2>
There are five types of celetials, in descending order of power: Elysiar, Nebular, Solar, Planetar, Stellar.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h125" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Origin</h3>
The first celestials created were the planetars in the event know as the First Great Seal, which marked the end of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anno%20Titanis.html" class="wikidpad">Anno Titanis</a></span>. Quultar created a new sphere completely outside Mortus that was to be the home for the jot. To enforce this migration of jot, Quultar split part of their essence to build the planetars that generally act as wardens between the spheres with special focus on preventing Jot from leaving <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Jotunheim.html" class="wikidpad">Jotunheim</a></span>. Promted by the Zeta Toll incident that ended the war between devils, jot, and demons for total control of Mortus, Quultar took drastic action to protect the primitive mortals. Quultar dissolved their own being into many component parts, which were named elysiars by Phaedros. These elysiars are the most powerful non-eternal entities from the ethos manifold and are the true power behind mortal prayers, they simply masquerade as "gods". No mortal knows this and the extraplanars that do are forbidden to tell them. To bring about the immediate end of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anno%20Hostis.html" class="wikidpad">Anno Hostis</a></span> the elysiars created the solars and stellars to drive the demons and devils back to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Sordidus.html" class="wikidpad">Sordidus</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Purgatus.html" class="wikidpad">Purgatus</a></span> respectively and to aid the collasping mortal population. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
There were several side effects from this single world changing event. The least important of these is that the sun became much brighter, especially during the rise and set. The largest is that as Quultar's power was dispersed to the elysiars, their bubbles of control within the manifold grew and sometimes when they first overlapped knots of Quultar's pure power were formed. These knots were infact three dimensional, forming ropes of power across the manifold. The elysiars can not resolve these ropes as their existence is causually connected to them. These ropes, or topoplogical defects in reality/Celestial Sphere, are what enable mortals to be wizards. Without these celestial ropes no wizardry would exist, only prayer, pacts, and other forms of extraplanar influence. Nothing other than the elysiars know these facts, but mortals have stumbled on part of the truth with the development of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Magic%20%26%20Materials.html" class="wikidpad">Threading</a></span>, in which they siphon a miniscule strand off of a celestial rope directly into an object. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The elysiars later caused the Calamity, but was it necessary to prevent Yharon from destroying all of ethos. Unpon the outer being's arrival the elysiars took emergency measures, by giving up their existence to reconstitue Quultar in order to fend off Yharon. This effort was ultimately successful. However, since the gods (elysiars) were gone no prayer worked and more importantly the celestial ropes where unwound. In combination with the highest tide of the [Astral Sea] cutting Mortus off from the other spheres all magic was effectively removed. Every wizard, sage, and arcanist were instatly destroyed as their bodies and souls had been weaved into the celestial rope. However, threaded items would later recover their magic after Quultar split into the elysiars once more reforming the celestial threads that enchanted them. Quultar also diverted part of their power to creating the host of nebulars which protect each of the spheres from the barrak'ix menance swarming in from the [Astral Sea]. The fallout of this redistribution of Quultar's power is that wizards will never exist again. <br class="wikidpad" />

One of the onyl reasons for stellars to come to Mortus on their own initiative is judging speakers and assimars that have reached a certain power level. They go to judge that mortal's with raw celestial power are not conterproductive to the celestial cause, combat is rarely involved.    {% endblock content%}
