After the second Great-Seal the night sky of Mortus was now filled bright points of light the humans called stars. These are infact <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Celestials.html" class="wikidpad">Stellar Celestials</a></span>, but at first mortals had several theories on what they were. With wizardry being invented around the same time many of the theories involved conflation of the two: stars were souls of wizards, wizards pulled power from them for magic, or that it was a great illusion. Other theories, mostly put forth by the clergy, revolved more around Quultar or the other gods they now had contact with. The most popular of all the theories was that it was holes in upper reaches of the plane that allowed Quultar to watch over mortals, which in a way was true but not accurate.
