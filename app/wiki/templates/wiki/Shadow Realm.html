The Shadow Fell, also known as the plane of terror or darkness, is a realm shrouded in mystery. The plane was created after the Second Great Seal but before the Eon of Memory. Created by a secret plot between Utumno, Narisa, and Ataxia the plane was made with the consent or knowledge of Quultar. The plane is filled with many foul things including undead, fiends, even crazier undead, Barrakix, and chiefly the God of Shadows. The nature of the Shadow is not known to Quultar, Rico, or Empyreon, it was created through the chaos of imagination. The Shadow Realm holds an especially strong connection to the lower planes, astral sea, and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Mat%20Trang.html" class="wikidpad">Mat Trang</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />

The only portals to it in the mundane world are found deep within the under-dark. Lulth is a reduced manifestation of the Shadow God in the mortal realm. Lulth first encountered the ancient dwarves and either through magical control or the promise of power beguiled them to live in the under-dark in service to her, creating the Duergar. However, their orderly nature and their preexisting reincarnation cycle, was displeasing to Lulth, a trait inherited from the handiwork of Ataxia. She tasked the duergar with capturing elves to be wreathed in darkness with her, little did the duergar know that these elves would become the drow that enslaved them under the mentoring of Lulth.<br class="wikidpad" />
