Drow have few cones, their vision being made up of rods giving excellent sight in darkness and low light. However, this comes at the cost of having poor color vision and being sensitive to bright light and taking a long time to adjust when moving from one to the other.<br class="wikidpad" />

The process for creating new drow is kept secret even from their own population. It is a ritual carried out by matriarchs that requires the sacrifice of several low-caste males. The males are taken to a gravity-well, where they are dissolved by a Night Walker, which are drow that have gone and joined Lulth. A matriarch then bathes in the solution and becomes pregnant, driders begin to develop many children. <br class="wikidpad" />
