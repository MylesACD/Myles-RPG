In the legendary battle between the two demi-gods: Warm Light of Dawn and Daam’nizkhus demon lord of domination, WLD dealt a critical blow against the fiend, cutting off his right hand. In the aftermath his numerous massive claws were harvested, these blades would be fashioned into swords of incredible demonic power. Most of these weapons were created by great uruk smiths, others were made by demons seeking to capture a piece of their former lord’s power. There was one blade forged by a devil at great personal cost,  with the fiend becoming entrapped. <br class="wikidpad" />
